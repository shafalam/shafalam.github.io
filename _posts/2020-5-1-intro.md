title: World is beautiful, so are its inhabitants

Today's world is devasted by a pandemic called covid-19. As of today 235000 people have died because of this disease.

Today, I am not gonna talk about that. Today I am gonna talk about humanty. Although we all are social distancing, but we are closer than ever. In Bangladesh, students are volunteering day and night so that helpless people don't spend a day without food. People are donating more than ever.

Scientists are racing for a cure to this solution. You might argue that is their profession. But I would say, an urgency to help people is the main drive force behind this.

Engineers of all sort coming forward to tackle this problem. Software engineers are trying to make a contact tracing app. Mechanical engineers are creating easy to use ventilators.

All of this is done only to save people, only to see the smile of another human being. There can be no other beautiful things than this.
